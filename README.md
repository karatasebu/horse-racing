When the application is first launched, this screen appears. There are buttons to navigate to different pages:  
- **Start** to go to the race start page,  
- **Horses** to view the list of horses,  
- **Program** to see the 6-round race schedule,  
- and **Results** to view the race results.

If no program has been created, this screen appears with a button to create one.  
Additionally, you can go to the program page via the **Program** tab at the top, where you can create the program and view all the rounds.

This is the race area.  
You can start the race by clicking the **Start** button at the top.  
Horses move toward the finish line based on their condition and randomly assigned speeds.  
As they move, a live **Leaderboard** appears at the top and updates in real time.  
The user can also see which round is currently in progress and the distance of that round.

After the race ends, a modal appears showing the results of the round with two options:  
- Go to the **Results** page to view other results,  
- or initialize the next round.  

If the last round has finished, instead of initializing the next round, the option to create a new program is offered.

This is the page where the horses are listed.  
Each horse's **name**, **color**, and **condition** information is displayed.

In the **Program** section, you can view all the rounds and see which horses will race in each of them.  
When you click the **Refresh** button, a new program is generated.  
If there is an ongoing race, it will be terminated and its results will be deleted.

The **Results** section contains information only about completed rounds.  
While the **Race** page shows the live results of the current round,  
this section displays all finished rounds after they have ended.
